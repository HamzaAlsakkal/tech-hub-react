# Vercel Deployment Instructions

Since we had some issues with the CLI method, please follow these steps to deploy your project using the Vercel web dashboard:

## Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open your web browser and go to [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in with GitHub (the same account where your repository is hosted)

## Step 2: Import Your Project
1. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project" button
2. Select your "tech-hub-react" repository from the list
3. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project

## Step 3: Configure Project
1. You can keep the default settings:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

2. Expand "Environment Variables" if you need to add any (not required for this project)

## Step 4: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy" button at the bottom of the page
2. Vercel will build and deploy your project

## Step 5: Check Deployment
1. Once deployment is complete, you'll see "Congratulations!" 
2. Click on the deployment URL to view your website
3. Make sure to test that all pages load correctly and routing works

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Make sure React Router works by testing all navigation links
3. Verify the Color Changer page loads correctly

## Project Structure Updates
I've already made these important changes to your project:
1. Fixed the build script in package.json to remove TypeScript requirement
2. Added vercel.json with routing rules for React Router
3. All changes have been committed and pushed to your GitHub repository

You should now be able to see your Tech Hub website live on Vercel!
